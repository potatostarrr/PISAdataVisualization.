#Summary
PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. We will see the difference of math performance between boys and girls in different countries and investigate the reason.


#Design
To show math score of different genders in different countries, I choose to use slop graph. By using slop graph, we can see the difference easily and we won’t be confused by lots of data. We use different color to mark different countries depending on whether girls have better score. 
If you are interested in any specific country, you can investigate it by clicking country name in slop graph. By clicking “Analyze” button near slop graph, you can see the different statistics between different types of countries. 
We use donut chart to show the result of questionnaire. The questionnaire can be divided into 6 domain. You can change domain and question to see different result. In any specific result, you can click legends of in the central area of donut chart to change the ratio of chart. You can easily compare the difference in male/female group and you also can see the gender ration for a specific answer.


#Feedback
First sketch:
It’s better to show a chart of different countries. 
So I add the function that you can investigate countries data by clicking country name.
It’s not clear what we can get from those chart.
So I add brief description of result for each question domain and brief analyze.
The slop graph is messy and it’s confused audience.
So I increase the width of slop graph and color lines to make some countries more clear.
Final sketch:
It’s more convenient to add a button near donut char which can select multiple legend.
It’s considerable to draw a map or bar char on current visualization.
Maybe we can change the color.
